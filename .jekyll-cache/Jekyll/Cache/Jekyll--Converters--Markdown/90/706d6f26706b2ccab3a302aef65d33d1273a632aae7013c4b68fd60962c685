<p>Throughout my life, I always choose to contribute every little tiny effort to make our world a better place. This inspirits me to build software applications that care for the users and utilize the technologies to enhance people's lives.</p>

		<h4>Android Developer (2017)</h4>
		<p>Project: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adventist-giving/id1305324406">Adventist Giving</a>.<br /><br />I was hired by <a href="https://www.southern.edu/academics/academic-sites/computing/circ.html">Center for Innovation and Research in Computing</a> at Southern Adventist University as a Student Intern in January 2017. This was my first-time ever for a computing job, and I did not know my passion for software development until after I start building a mobile application from scratch. My manager at the time inspired to work towards improving myself as programmer, not towards getting things done. Within only 8 months, without skipping a week of work, I successfully programmed a fully-functioning Android. The application is called Adventist Giving and it is published on Google App Store. To see more information about this project, please see my projects page.</p>

		<h3>IT Department, SAU</h3>
		<h4>iOS Developer (2018 - Present)</h4>
		<p>Project: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/southern-adventist-university/id387200764">Southern Adventist University</a>, Attendance Tracking System, ATS API, Room Schedule.<br /><br />I have been working for IT department at Southern Adventist University since April 2018. Fast forward from the time I worked on Android development, now my next challenge was iOS. I fell in love with the very informative and modern looking of Xcode and the Swift language. This helped me a lot in learning the tools and becoming an iOS Developer. The job assigned me to build functions and improve the Southern Adventist University iOS application. I was also building MVC web apps for the official website of the school. See my projects page.</p>

		<h3>Personal</h3>
		<p>Project: <a href="https://github.com/2-letters/Laboratory.iOS">Laboratory</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kohnewlife/Klozet">Klozet</a>.<br /><br />Everyone of us, once in a while, has an awesome idea and then let it go just minutes later. I feel sad knowing that happens. This is why I decided to spend my freetime to transform some of my stupid ideas into useful products. The two biggest ones are Laboratory and Klozet.
