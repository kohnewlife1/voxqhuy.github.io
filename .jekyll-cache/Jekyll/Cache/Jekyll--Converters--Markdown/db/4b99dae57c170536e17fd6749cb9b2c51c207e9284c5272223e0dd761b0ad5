<h2 id="content">WHAT I CAN DO</h2>
<div class="row">
	<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Develop</h3>
		<p>Just like any other developer, I enjoy building applications from scratch the most. My two years in iOS development also include implementing functionalities and maintaining an existing iOS application. I will be more excited about the products that customers are getting than what I have to do.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Unit Test</h3>
		<p>In every technical project, testing is an important task and cannot be overlooked as it confirms that an application satisfies customers' requirements and notably enhance the quality of a final product. With this in mind, I'm always willing to put as much time into testing as into production code. I have been testing all of my projects for a year now and will keep improving my skills on this.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Clean Code</h3>
		<p>Now, this sounds out of place here, doesn't it? I, however, believe Clean Code principles belong a stand due to their values in a project. Developers often complain about wasting hours to understand some messy code by their partners. I have just practiced clean code recently and realized how significantly it could improve the development productivity.

		<h3>Android Developer <i>(2017)</i></h3>
		<p>I was hired by the <a href="https://www.southern.edu/academics/academic-sites/computing/circ.html">Center for Innovation and Research in Computing</a> (CIRC) at Southern Adventist University as a Student Programmer in January 2017. My manager, Michael, inspired me to work more effectively and professionally. Within only 8 months, without skipping a workweek, I successfully programmed a fully-functioning <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.andr.adventistgiving">Adventist Giving </a> application from scratch.</p>

		<h3>iOS Developer <i>(2018 - Present)</i></h3>
		<p>My journey with iOS officially started in April 2018 when IT Department at SAU hired me as an intern. I fell in love with the very informative and modern looking of Xcode and the Swift language. This helped me a lot in learning the tools and becoming an iOS Developer. The job assigned me to build functions and improve the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/southern-adventist-university/id387200764">Southern Adventist University</a> iOS application.</p>

		<h3>Personal</h3>
		<p>Everyone of us, once in a while, has an awesome idea and then let it go just minutes later. I feel sad knowing that happens. This is why I decided to spend my freetime to transform some of my stupid ideas into useful products. The two biggest ones are <a href="https://github.com/2-letters/Laboratory.iOS">Laboratory</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/kohnewlife/Klozet">Klozet</a>.</p>
