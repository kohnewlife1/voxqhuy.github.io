		<h3>Developing</h3>
		<p>I was hired by the <a href="https://www.southern.edu/academics/academic-sites/computing/circ.html">Center for Innovation and Research in Computing</a> (CIRC) at Southern Adventist University as a Student Intern in January 2017. My manager at the time inspired me to work towards improving myself as a programmer, not towards getting things done. Within only 8 months, without skipping a week of work, I successfully programmed a fully-functioning Android application from scratch. The application is called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.andr.adventistgiving">Adventist Giving</a>, and available on Google App Store.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>I have been working for the IT department at Southern Adventist University since April 2018. My journey with iOS officially started. I fell in love with the very informative and modern looking of Xcode and the Swift language. This helped me a lot in learning the tools and becoming an iOS Developer. The job assigned me to build functions and improve the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/southern-adventist-university/id387200764">Southern Adventist University</a> iOS application. I was also building MVC web apps for the official website of the school.</p>

	<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Refactoring</h3>
		<p>Everyone of us, once in a while, has an awesome idea and then let it go just minutes later. I feel sad knowing that happens. This is why I decided to spend my freetime to transform some of my stupid ideas into useful products. The two biggest ones are <a href="https://github.com/2-letters/Laboratory.iOS">Laboratory</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/kohnewlife/Klozet">Klozet</a>.
